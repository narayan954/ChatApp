### Welcome to my Backend Web Dev: Real-Time Chat App challenge submission!

### Live website https://live.up.railway.app/
#### Description
In this project, weâ€™ll demonstrate backend web development skills by building a simple client-server chat application using Node JS and WebSockets. The application will allow multiple clients to communicate with each other in real-time through a web interface. The core functionality of the application will be creating a WebSocket connection between the client and server using socket.io and sending information from one client to another client using the server.

Required Components:
- Node JS on your machine.
- Active Internet connection.

Setup Instructions:
- Go to the root directory and open terminal.
- Run `npm i` or `npm install` to install all of the required dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the server. This will serve our application on default port 3000 if not defined in the environment variables explicitly.
- In any browser, browse to `localhost:<PORT NUMBER>` to access our chat application. `PORT NUMBER` should be visible on console/terminal as well(default 3000)
- You may browse the application on multiple browser windows to get different client connections and chat.
